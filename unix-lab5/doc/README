proxy.c: proxy server can handle http requests generated by the browser

Makefile: compiles proxy.c

forbidden-sites.txt: text file with banned websites

Lab_5_Documentation: explains design of proxy.c

README: lists all files that are submitted

Issues involving my code: I am not able to block the last website in the forbidden sites text file. I also can only block word for word the website in the text file. For example if www.cnn.com is in the text file, it will get blocked but cnn.com will not. The forwarded header that I added to the request sometimes does not get sent. When I log the object size in bytes, the value is sometimes not accurate. The HTTP code that is logged is also sometimes not accurate. When I run my program using curl, I am able to get the right information and send it. When I run my program using Firefox as a proxy, I get random requests and affects the information that is logged. I was able to test my proxy better using curl. I tried to implement concurrency using threads but not sure if it works correctly.
