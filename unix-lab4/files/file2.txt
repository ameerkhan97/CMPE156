Hi there! Looks like you're visiting from the US – and that means that it's not allowed to make the “Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes” available for download. This will change in stages starting from January 1st, 2019 to January 1st, 2023, but for the time being the Case-Book remains protected by US copyright laws.
